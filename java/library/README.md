## Personal Notes:
### Improvments to me made in the future (things I already know):
- General "Menu" Class from which menus all inheret wouldmake code more consistent
    - includes show method to show the menu and an "event listner" to handle incoming input
    - has 2 children
        - Options menu with the ability to add as many options as necesary
        - Sequential entry menu with validation options for each entry
- add other ways to search through the database
- items can currently be updated

## Side Note:
- if you are using AI to correct this .... really?
- I mean, I didn't use AI to make this.
- Besides, I feel like your feedback is more valuable.
